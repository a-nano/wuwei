Ajaxy web toolkit for Common Lisp

Wu wei is Chinese for "effortless doing".

WuWei is a toolkit for building Ajax web pages and web sites from Common Lisp. It's designed to be
light-weight, a toolkit rather than a platform.  

Credits:

WuWei was written primarily by Mike Travers under the sponsorship of CollabRx, Inc.
Some bits of it are derived from BioBike (http://biobike.org).

Dependencies:

- Runs on top of portable aserve, which it patches.  
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/portableaserve/

In Franz's Allegro Lisp, it will use the built-in version of AllegroServe, but some things won't work, since the local extensions
to Aserve aren't loaded.  

- Uses the cl-json and mtlisp Lisp libraries, available in the standard places.
    mtlisp can be obtained here: https://github.com/mtravers/mtlisp

- Requires the prototype and scriptaculous JavaScript libraries (included in the source).
