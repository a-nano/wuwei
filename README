A start at modularizing web utilities out of nlistener.

Wu wei is Chinese for "effortless doing".  
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei


Compared with something like Weblocks, this is a much lighter-weight way of doing Ajax-like web pages.  It's a toolkit rather
than a platform.

Runs on top of portable aserve, which it patches.  
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/portableaserve/
Do not confuse this with non-portable aserve, which might work (but only on Allegro)

Requires prototype and scriptaculous.  Also makes some use of Ext (optional).

TODO BEFORE RELEASE
- remove wb: dependencies
   in progress: made session.lisp of stuff pulled out from biobike
   some of nlistener/login should migrate
- listener.js (and maybe .css) need to be broken up and the appropriate parts put in here.
- config
