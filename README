Ajaxy web toolkit for Common Lisp

Wu wei is Chinese for "effortless doing".  
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei

WuWei is a toolkit for building Ajax web pages and web sites in Common Lisp. It's designed to be
light-weight, a toolkit rather than a platform.  

Features:
- Continuation-based AJAX user interfaces
- Server-side high-level DOM operations (add/remove elements, visual fades, drag and drop)
- High-level interfaces to in-place-editing and autocomplete widgets
- Login and session management

Examples:

Credits:

  WuWei was written primarily by Mike Travers, originally under the sponsorship of CollabRx, Inc.
  Some bits of it are derived from BioBike (http://biobike.org).

Requirements/dependencies:

- A Common Lisp implementation.  WuWei has been run in Allegro, Clozure (aka OpenMCL), and SBCL, and ought to run in other implementations.
- mtlisp, a utility package available here.
  https://github.com/mtravers/mtlisp
- Other libraries (aserve or portable aserve, cl-json, and their dependcies)
  (These may be obtained via QuickLisp)
- Uses the prototype and scriptaculous JavaScript libraries 
  (included in the source).

INSTALL:

Easiest using QuickLisp:

1) install QuickLisp from http://www.quicklisp.org/
2) install some packages via QuickLisp:
   (ql:quickload "acl-compat") [** note for OpenMCL]
   (ql:quickload "cl-json")
3) (load "/misc/repos/wuwei/wuwei.asd")
   (load "/misc/repos/mtlisp/mtlisp.asd")
4) (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :wuwei)
   (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :wuwei-examples)

[** Note: in OpenMCL, you will need to manually patch a file in acl-compat:
   ~/quicklisp/dists/quicklisp/software/portableaserve-20101006-cvs/acl-compat/mcl/acl-socket-openmcl.lisp
   Add the keyword argument stream-args to the accept-connection method]
