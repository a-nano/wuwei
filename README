A start at modularizing web utilities out of nlistener.

Compared with something like Weblocks, this is a much lighter-weight way of doing Ajax-like web pages.  It's a toolkit rather
than a platform.

Runs on top of portable aserve, which it patches.

Requires prototype and scriptaculous.  Also makes some use of Ext (optional).

TODO BEFORE RELEASE
- Needs patched version of cl-json.
- listener.js (and maybe .css) need to be broken up and the appropriate parts put in here.
- config
