A start at modularizing web utilities out of nlistener.

Compared with something like Weblocks, this is a much lighter-weight way of doing Ajax-like web pages.  It's a toolkit rather
than a platform.

Runs on top of portable aserve, which it patches.  
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/portableaserve/
Do not confuse this with non-portable aserve, which might work (but only on Allegro)
  

Requires prototype and scriptaculous.  Also makes some use of Ext (optional).

TODO BEFORE RELEASE
- remove wb: dependencies
- listener.js (and maybe .css) need to be broken up and the appropriate parts put in here.
- config
