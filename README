Ajaxy web utilities for Common Lisp

Wu wei is Chinese for "effortless doing".  
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei

WuWei is a toolkit for building Ajax web pages and web sites from Common Lisp. It's designed to be
light-weight, a toolkit rather than a platform.  

Runs on top of portable aserve, which it patches.  
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/portableaserve/

Do not confuse this with non-portable aserve.  Wuwei might work with that, but it hasn't been
tested.

Requires prototype and scriptaculous.  Also makes some use of Ext (optional).
