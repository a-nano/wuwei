A start at modularizing web utilities out of nlistener.

Compared with something like Weblocks, this is a much lighter-weight way of doing Ajax-like web pages.  It's a toolkit rather
than a platform.

Runs on top of portable aserve.

Requires prototpe and scriptaculous.  Also makes some use of Ext (optional).

Needs patched version of cl-json.
